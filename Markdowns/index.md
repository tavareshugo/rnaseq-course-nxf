## Instructors

* Erin Doody - Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge
* Ian Tsang - NIAB

## Outline

In this workshop, you will be learning how to analyse RNA-seq data. This will
include read alignment, quality control, quantification against a reference,
reading the count data into R, performing differential expression analysis, and
gene set testing, with a focus on the DESeq2 analysis workflow. You will learn
how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of gene expression
data, such as boxplots and heatmaps.

This workshop is aimed at biologists interested in learning how to perform
differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.
