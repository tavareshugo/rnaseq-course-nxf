# ANalysis of Bulk RNA-seq Data

## Instructors

* Hugo Tavares - Bioinformatics Training Facility, University of Cambridge
* Raquel Manzano Garcia - Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute
* 


## Outline

In this workshop, you will be learning how to analyse RNA-seq data. This will
include read alignment, quality control, quantification against a reference,
reading the count data into R, performing differential expression analysis, and
gene set testing, with a focus on the DESeq2 analysis workflow. You will learn
how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of gene expression
data, such as boxplots and heatmaps.

This workshop is aimed at biologists interested in learning how to perform
differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.

Whilst we have run this course for several years, we are still improving and learning how to
teach it best.  
Please bear with us if there are any technical hitches, and
be aware that timings for different sections laid out in the schedule below may
not be adhered to. There may be some necessity to make adjustments to the course
as we go.
